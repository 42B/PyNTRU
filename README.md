# PyNTRU

This is my version of NTRUEncrypt written in Python 3. It is currently for research purposes only. I strongly reccomend (perhaps demand) that this implementation is not used for sensitive data. It has not been vetted and is probably insecure.


## Install

```bash

git clone https://github.com/smarky7CD/PyNTRU.git

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```

## Using

You can use the Parameters object to generate private and public keys. Look at the encryption test for examples.

## Testing

* Polynomial: Passing
* NTRU Polynomial Operations: Passing
* NTRU Parameters (Polynomial Generation): Passing
* Encryption and Decryption: Passing
